**J.K. Rowling != God**

Everything taken from Gemini highlighted in blue üòÅ

Core argument:



1. Our strong moral intuition is that J.K. Rowling did nothing wrong by creating a fictional world that contains genuine evil and suffering (Voldemort, the deaths of beloved characters, etc.). We see her as an author, not an accomplice to fictional murder or torture.
2. The relationship between God and our universe is analogous to the relationship between Rowling and her universe. Both are creators of a world and the beings within it.
3. Therefore, if our moral intuition absolves Rowling, we should be consistent and also absolve God of wrongdoing for creating a world that contains evil and suffering.

But Harry Potter isn‚Äôt real!

Well yes obviously, but doesn‚Äôt something feel intuitively appealing about this parallel?

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Framework: Dimensions (Harry Potter is actually real!)</span>

Harry Potter is real **in some different ‚Äòdimension‚Äô** ‚Äì his experience and consciousness are real but not observable from our ‚Äòdimension‚Äô. God is on a higher/different ‚Äòdimension‚Äô than us, we are on a higher/different dimension than fictional characters we create. This is inherently an unprovable claim, and also very meta; ‚ÄòYou must assert that our deeply felt reality is just one "level" among many.‚Äô


    If a god is real, who cannot be *physicall*y measured or observed, is this kind of like another ‚Äòlevel‚Äô of reality? Is the domain of imagination, where fictional characters exist, another ‚Äòlevel‚Äô of reality?

Anyways if this is the case, we have that:



* creator creates beings with consciousness/experience
* creator determines the courses of the creations‚Äô lives (more on free will later)
* creator chooses to introduce evil and suffering

And the analogy holds! The implication is that there is some sort of **creator exemption**, something like: the creator creates with a purpose, and judging the morality of creators is a ‚Äòcategory error‚Äô.

One issue: does anything that is created have its own consciousness then? Like the color blue, the number 4, etc.? I know some people believe [everything has consciousness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhGy-pj1yw0), but this starts to get a bit wonky. You might have to limit the scope to ‚Äòrepresentations of people‚Äô or something weaker‚Ä¶

The other issue is obviously that accepting Harry Potter to be ‚Äòreal‚Äô is speculative + borderline ridiculous, but even then: if this argument is truly followed to the end, I think Tony is right, and we should question our intuition‚Ä¶ It seems like J.K. Rowling is wrong for causing ‚Äòreal‚Äô suffering! (Rediscussed at the end)

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Alternative approach: We aren‚Äôt actually real</span>

Harry Potter is just text on a page, but are we not the same? If we picture God as the ultimate author who writes everything that will ever be into existence, what makes our consciousness/experience any more real? Humans are physical and more complex, but still just informational structure. A little dubious‚Ä¶

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Note on free will</span>

In our discussion, I was reminded of complementarian free will ‚Äì the analogy is that there is some chip in your brain that will override you if you do the ‚Äòwrong‚Äô thing, but it NEVER overrides. In this experiment, are you free? Anyways this is a neat way of understanding free-ness: we could have never done otherwise, but there is still some notion of agency/choice. For this question though, the free-ness of us and Harry Potter are the same, in that suffering is predetermined by the creator and we could never do otherwise.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">The real issue</span>

**Unfortunately, all that being said, I don‚Äôt think this analogy is all that powerful**. We need to ask: what is the source of this intuitive, internal desire to not ‚Äòcondemn‚Äô J.K. Rowling?

Why does that matter? Consider this faulty analogy*:*



1. Intuitively, human beings deserve rights.
2. Humans are ‚Äòanalogous‚Äô to chairs, in that we are real/physical objects.
3. If our intuition grants human rights, we should be consistent and grant chairs rights as well.

The principle here is, you can‚Äôt just arbitrarily find a similarity/connection and prove any claim using it; there must be some relationship between similarity and claim. Is this faulty chair analogy that different from the Harry Potter one?

To be specific, we have:



* Subject 1: J.K. Rowling
* Subject 2: God
* Shared characteristic: the creation of real, conscious beings
* Claim about Subject 1: we don't hold *subject *to any moral fault‚Ä¶ intuitively

What is the relation between the shared characteristic and the claim, for an analogy to be effective?


    Analogies are not a form of strict, deductive proof (like a mathematical theorem). They are a powerful form of inductive reasoning. They don't guarantee a conclusion is true, but they argue that it is *probable *or *plausible*.


    ‚Ä¶


    The "therefore" in your structure logically makes sense only if the shared connection (C) is **directly relevant** to the intuition or property (P) you are trying to transfer from X to Y.

So unfortunately, I think you have to question/break down the source of our intuition‚Ä¶ What are the **relevant** characteristics to our intuition-based property? Before even bringing God into the picture, what about J.K. Rowling makes our intuition absolve her of any wrongdoing?


    Your entire argument‚Äîas powerful as it is‚Äîhinges on whether your initial intuition holds up under pressure. Is our absolution of an author an absolute principle for all creators, or is it conditional on the non-sentience of their characters?

This is not a proof, but my strong suspicion is that our intuition is mostly grounded in the latter: Harry Potter lacks something humans have, whether it be realness, consciousness, or physical substance, and it is this difference that explains the intuition. Then, J.K. Rowling is not analogous to God, and the analogy doesn‚Äôt hold. This was indeed the common-sense answer all along, but I needed to formalize this logic and learn how to use analogies properly.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Conclusion</span>

The similarities between God and J.K. Rowling are compelling, but they are **not similar enough**! To me this interesting thought experiment doesn‚Äôt answer The Problem of Evil, but still posits that creators have purposes and aren‚Äôt necessarily bound by the moral code of their creation.
