Defining the so-called “hot hand”
---------------------------------

The hot hand is an age-old basketball trope, where it is conventional knowledge that a shooter who has made multiple consecutive shots is more likely to make his next shot, as he is in the zone! It then takes a slew of missed shots to then cool him back down. This thinking is still prevalent in modern-day sports — from a recent article from CBS Sports on an upcoming 2021 playoff match between the Bucks and Celtics, the author writes:

> “[Jaylen Brown] is a streaky shooter on the outside…”.

This phenomenon has been controversial: a [study conducted in 1985](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028585900106?via%3Dihub=) concluded that the hot hand is simply randomness, and that any perceived effect is just flawed human reasoning observing non-existent patterns. This “hot hand fallacy” has then received some pushback, with more recent statistical studies seeming to confirm such an effect.
